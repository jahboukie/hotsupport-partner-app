Second, listen more than you talk. Try saying "Tell me more about that" instead of jumping in with solutions. Third, ask "What do you need from me right now?" - sometimes it's advice, sometimes it's just someone to vent to.

Don't take rejection personally - it's often about physical discomfort, not desire. Focus on other ways to connect - holding hands, cuddling, just being close without expectations. Talk to her about what feels good and what doesn't. This phase won't last forever, but understanding will make it easier for both of you.`;

Some days it might be a cold drink, some days it's just someone to listen. Pay attention to the little things - do extra around the house without being asked, bring her favorite tea, or just sit with her quietly. The key is consistency - show up for her every day, even in small ways.`;
